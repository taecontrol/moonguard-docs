# Meet MoonGuard

Moonguard is an open source [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) plugin that
aims to provide utilities to monitor all your Laravel applications in production
from a single place.

MoonGuard helps you track important features like SSL certificates status, uptime,
and exceptions on your applications. By doing so, you can detect issues quickly
and save time and money while your apps are in production. This platform allows
you to monitor all these features in a single place.

MoonGuard is still in early development so your feedback for improvement or bug
reports are well appreciated.
