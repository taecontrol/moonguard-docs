# Introduction

Moonguard is an open source Filament plugin that aims to provide utilities to
monitor your Laravel apps in production.

MoonGuard helps you track important features like SSL certificates status,
uptime, and exceptions on your applications. By doing so, you can detect issues
quickly and save time and money while your apps are in production. This platform
allows you to monitor all these features in a single place.

MoonGuard is still in early development so your feedback for improvement or bug
reports are well appreciated.
